Since the primary structural characteristic of a school that functions as a PLC at
Work is collaborative teaming, the vast majority of work that takes place is practitioner
driven, DuFour and Eaker did not coin the term professional learning communities.
Others had done that prior to 1998 (Hord, 1997; Little & McLaughlin, 1993). What

AllThingsPLC
In addition to books, Solution Tree provides a completely commerce-free digital
resource—the AllThingsPLC website (https://allthingsplc.info). This free site pro-
vides detailed information on and contact information for hundreds of Model PLC at
Work schools and districts across the world. Every Model PLC has effectively imple-
mented all the essential elements of the PLC at Work process and has achieved mul-
tiple years of significant, sustained improvement in student achievement. The list of
Model PLCs is searchable by level (elementary school, middle school, high school,
and district), school size, demographics, and location, and these schools will gladly
share what they have learned. We highly recommend utilizing this valuable resource
when you want to see how the practices this book describes are being implemented in
real schools.
A Journey Worth Taking
Despite the popularity of the term professional learning community, the practices of a
PLC continue to represent the road less traveled in public education. Many teachers
and administrators prefer the familiarity of their current path, even when it becomes
apparent that it will not take them to their desired destination. We recognize it is dif-
ficult to pursue an uncharted path, particularly when it will include inevitable bumps
and potholes along the way. We do not argue that the PLC journey is an easy one, but
we know with certainty that it is a journey worth taking. We have seen the evidence
of improved learning and heard the testimonials of teachers and principals who have
been renewed by establishing common ground, a clear purpose, effective monitoring,
and collaborative processes that lead to better results. These individuals describe a
heightened sense of professionalism and a resurgence of energy and enthusiasm that We do not argue
committed people have generated while working together to accomplish what they that the PLC
could not do alone. As school change expert Robert Evans (1996) writes: journey is an
easy one, but

agit fevers. of what the organization must become in order to help all students learn. They make
collective commitments, clarifying what cach member will do to create such an orga-
nization, and they use results-oriented goals to mark their progress. Members work
together to clarify exactly what each student must learn, monitor each student's learn-
ing on a timely basis, provide systematic interventions that ensure students receive
additional time and support for learning when they struggle, and extend learning
when students have already mastered the intended outcomes.

A corollary assumption is that if the organization is to become more effective in
helping all students learn, the adults in the organization must also be continually
learning. Therefore, structures are created to ensure staff members engage in job-
embedded learning as part of their routine work practices.

There is no ambiguity or hedging regarding this commitment to learning. Whereas
many schools operate as if their primary purpose is to ensure students are taught or are
merely provided with an opportunity to learn, PLCs are dedicated to the idea that their
organizations exist to ensure all students actually acquire the essential knowledge,
skills, and dispositions of each unit, course, and grade level. Every potential organiza-
tional practice, policy, and procedure is assessed on the basis of this question: “Will
this ensure higher levels of learning for our students?” All the other characteristics of a
PLC flow directly from this epic shift in assumptions about the purpose of the school.

A Collaborative Culture and Collective
Responsibility

The second big idea driving the PLC process is that in order to ensure all students
earn at high levels, educators must work collaboratively and take collective responsibility for
the success of each student. Working collaboratively is not optional, but instead is an
expectation and requirement of employment. Consequently, the fundamental structure
