About This Book
We wrote this book with students in mind first and foremost. We wanted to make
sure educators had the tools needed to continue helping students learn and develop
productive life skills (additional tools in their inner toolkit) to help them with school
and life. We provide educators with a range of application options for how to uti-
lize behavior academies. Whether you are a school administrator, behavior interven-
tion team member, classroom teacher, school counselor, school psychologist, school
social worker, or even parent or guardian, you will find the thinking and resources
behind behavior academies beneficial regardless of how formalized or informalized you
decide to implement them. We wrote this book in a manner that allows you to decide
what level of implementation will be the best fit for students. We provide a formal-
ized behavior intervention structure (behavior academies structure) that intervention
team members can use, but we also provide additional informal ways of utilizing the
resources to help teachers support their students and even support patents or guard-
ians at home.
Let's take a look at what you'll find in the chapters that follow. In chapter 1 (page 9),
you receive the opportunity to explore and self-reflect on the behavior mindset neces-
sary for the successful implementation of behavior academies. In chapter 2 (page 19),

We knew we had two choices: (1) continue using the same ineffective exclusionary
practices such as suspension and hope that, through simple maturation, these boys
would “grow out of” these behaviors, or (2) use this incident to teach and practice
new ways to appropriately respond so these negative behaviors would not repeat in the
future. We decided to try the second option.
