A Guide to Action for  
Professional Learning Communities at Work  
_____________________ 
 
Chapter 1 serves as an introduction to Learning by Doing. In addition to presenting the 
purposes and format of the book, the authors make the point that in rece nt years , the term 
professional learning communities  has been used to describe virtually any loose coupling 
of individuals who share a common interest in education. In fact, the term has become so 
ambiguous that it is in danger of losing all meaning. Chapt er 1 clarifies the meaning of 
professional learning community . Reflect on the following questions, and clarify what 
PLC means in your school or district . 
 
1. What is the fundamental purpose of your school? The very essence of a learning community is a focus on and a commitment to the learning of each student. If visitors came to your school for the very first time, what behaviors would they observe that would indicate learning was indeed the central, overriding purpose of the school?  
 2. One of the major differen ces between a more traditional school and a school that 
functions as a PLC is that a PLC shifts from a focus on teaching to a focus on learning. If your school adopted learning as its fundamental purpose, what 
questions would teachers, staff, and administr ators ask ? What questions would the 
community as a whole ask of itself?

(Second Edition) —Action Guide

--3-- 3. In a PLC, there is no ambiguity regarding the commitment to learning, and not 
just the learning of students. Adults in a learning community are continually learning. How does your school promote learning for the adults who work there?  
 4. In their book The Knowing- Doing Gap ( 2000) , Pfeffer and Sutton argue that most 
organizations already know what is required to be successful but fail to act. What are some factors that contribute to a scho ol administration or staff’s failure to 
implement what we know will help all students learn at high levels? What are some ways your school’s staff or administration has attempted to overcome these barriers?  
 
5. Assume your school is engaged in implementing the professional learning community concept and a reporter is interviewing you for a story for the local newspaper. How would you respond if the reporter asked the question, “Exactly what is a professional learning community?”  Reflect on how others in your s chool 
or district might respond to this question. Would the answers be fairly consistent?  
How consistent would their answers be with the definition the authors provide on page 11?  
 
6. It is critical that faculty and staff develop a deep, rich understanding of  the 
professional learning community concept and practices. How has your district or school approached the task of ensuring that everyone has gained a common understanding and a common vocabulary?  What resources were utilized?  In spite 

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--4-- of the efforts that have been undertaken, are there remaining faculty and staff who 
have only a cursory understanding of the professional learning community concept? If so, what steps need to be taken to make sure everyone has an accurate understanding of the professional lea rning community concept and related 
practices?  
 
7. Has a detailed assessment of the current reality of the state of student learning levels in your school been undertaken?  If so, what strengths were revealed?  What 
areas need the most immediate attention?  If your school has not assessed its 
current reality, what would need to be done in order to complete such an assessment?  
 
8. Michael Fullan (2005, p. 67) has observed that “terms travel easily  . . . but the 
meaning of the underlying concepts do not.” When listeni ng to the language in 
your school, how precise is the understanding of important PLC terms? How consistently are terms defined? How much time is spent developing a deep, rich understanding of key terms and concepts?  
 
9. The authors quote Mike Schmoker (2004, p. 85) as observing, “Clarity precedes competence.” As you begin to clarify the term professional learning community , 
think of each of these words:  professional , learning, and community . How would 
you define each of these terms? More specifically, what be haviors would one 
exhibit if he or she behaved in a professional  manner? What behaviors would one

--5-- exhibit if he or she focused on learning and if he or she conducted his or her work 
as part of a community ?  
 
Activity  
The opening pages of chapter 1 list six  essential elements of a PLC. Write one element at 
the top of each of six separate sheets of chart paper, leaving space to write below. Number the pages one through six, and post them around the room. Count off by six into small groups. Each group should m ove to the essential element with the corresponding 
number as a starting point for a gallery walk.  
 Discuss the ways in which the essential element is evident in your school or district with your small group, and write the best example on the chart paper. After three  minutes, 
move to the next piece of chart paper, and repeat the process until each group has rotated around the entire room and discussed each of the essential elements. After returning to the starting point, choose one person to report aloud to the whole group.

A Clear and Compelling Purpose  
 _____________________ 
 
In this chapter, the authors make the case that the very essence of a PLC is a focus on and 
a commitment to the learning of each student. In fact, this commitment to high  levels of 
learning for all students is the core mission of schools. But how does a school move beyond the pleasant platitudes of a generic mission statement to a culture in which learning is at the center of the day -to-day work of schooling? Reflect on the following 
questions . 
 
1. In reality, many schools have multiple purposes that go unstated: ensuring the happiness of the adults who work there, protecting individual personal autonomy, providing a place for teachers to teach, and so on. While it is true tha t schools are 
asked to do many things, what do you think is the most basic, fundamental purpose of your school? What behaviors have you observed that lead you to your answer?  
 2. In the case study, Principal Cynthia Dion set out to reculture her school into a  
PLC by developing a new school mission statement. What are the limitations of relying on a mission statement to change a school’s culture? How has your school gone beyond writing a mission statement to embed learning as the core purpose into the culture of your school?  
 

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--7-- 3. The authors make the case that developing a guiding coalition is a powerful 
strategy in the change process. Principal Dion would have benefited from working through issues with a small group of key staff and securing them as allies before engaging the entire faculty. Have you ever used a guiding coalition to get things 
done in your school? What was your experience? Who would be some of the key faculty to recruit for a guiding coalition in your school?  
 
4. The authors point out that the biggest process mistake the principal made was her failure to build shared knowledge among her staff. Building shared knowledge is the way questions are answered and issues are resolved in a PLC. What are two or three major issues that need to be addressed in your  school? What are some ways 
the faculty could be engaged in building shared knowledge around these issues? What resources could be made available to assist the faculty in building shared knowledge?  
 
5. The authors articulate a number of actions the principal and staff in the case study 
could have taken to convey their commitme nt to improving their school. Compare 
the authors’ suggestions with actions your school has taken to convey a commitment to improving your school?  Were the effects of your school’s 
improvement actions monitored?  If so, how effective have your school’s actions 
been? What additional actions need to be taken?  
 

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--8-- 6. Of course, there is often a huge difference between the school we desire and our 
willingness to behave in ways essential to creating s uch a school. This issue is 
addressed in professional learning communities by developing collective 
commitments  each staff member must honor if the school the staff has envisioned 
is to become a reality . What are some key commitments that would need to be 
made if your school were to function as a PLC? Why do you feel the authors emphasize these commitments should be stated as behaviors rather than beliefs?  
 
7. Reflect on this statement: “When something is truly a priority in an organization, people do not hope  it happens; they develop and implement specific plans to 
ensure that it happens.” What gets planned for in your school?  
 
8. Has your school involved staff in setting short -term goals that , if achieved , would 
move the school toward the agreed- upon vision? If your school accomplished 
every improvement goal, what would be the impact on student learning?  
 
9. It has been said that what gets monitored, gets done. Describe how priorities are monitored and how results are shared with the staff. 
 
10. Organizations demonstrat e priorities through the allocation of resources —time, 
money, and human resources. Are the resources in your school allocated according to proclaimed priorities?  

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--9-- 11. It has been said that you can tell what is important to someone simply by looking 
at what is o n the front of his or her refrigerator door —pictures of loved ones, 
daily schedules, to -do lists, and other things that matter. Using the refrigerator 
door as a metaphor, what would be on your school’s “refrigerator door”? In other words, what really matte rs—takes precedence—in your school?  
 12. If you were going to make a movie about your school, what would be the title of the movie? Why would you choose this particular title?  
 
13. The authors describe a number of “dangerous detours” school leaders might encounter  while working to articulate a clear and compelling purpose. Have you 
experienced any of these?  If so, what has been done to “get back on track” and 
continue to move forward?  What have you personally learned as your school has 
encountered various dangerous  detours?  
 
Activity 1  
 
Count off by threes into small groups; work with people you might not see on a daily basis. Working first on your own and then with the other members of your small group, think of ways professionals in your school demonstrate a commi tment to learning as the 
primary purpose. Be specific about the initiatives your school has undertaken and why the program, policy, or procedure has promoted learning as the fundamental purpose of the school. Record your examples on chart paper, and choose  the best example to share 
with the entire group.

Imagine that the local television station has provided you with a sixty -second spot on the 
evening news to help the community understand the PLC initiative that is underway in 
your school. Devel op your presentation, keeping in mind that you cannot go over sixty  
seconds, you do not want to leave thirty  seconds of “dead” air because you have run out 
of things to say, and you do not want to use a lot of jargon. Work with a partner as you create your  presentation, and be sure to give each other feedback throughout the process.  
 
Activity 3  
 
Use the continuum provided in this chapter (pages 44–49) to r eflect on the progress your 
school has made . Where would you place your school in each of the various c ategories?  
What would need to be done to move along the continuum to the next level on the journey to becoming a high- performing professional learning community?

Creating a Focus on Learning  
 _____________________ 
 
This chapter  is based on the  proposition that the fundamental purpose of schools is to 
ensure high levels of learning for all students. Professional learning communities clarify 
exactly what students are to learn and then monitor each student’s learning on a timely basis. Reflect on the following questions to clarify the assumptions, processes, and 
procedures that support the learning mission of your school . 
 
1. If learning is, in fact, the fundamental purpose of a school, the next obvious question is, “Learn what?” To what degree have c ollaborative teams examined, 
clarified, prioritized, and made public the essential outcomes for every subject, grade, course, and unit? Why would such an endeavor be necessary if the state and/or district have already provided schools with curriculum guide s? 
 2. On page 66, the authors describe how teachers in the White River School D istrict 
clarify  student learning outcomes by asking teams to reach agreement regarding 
what each standard, if mastered, would look like in terms of student work. What 
would be the  advantages of teams collaboratively addressing this question?  
 
3. In the case study, the authors describe a school where teachers resisted attempts to agree on the most essential learnings for students. Has this happened in your school? Why do teachers somet imes resist making a commitment to a common 

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--12--  curriculum? Identify sources of resistance, and discuss or reflect on ways to 
respond.  
 
4. Ownership is a key factor in whether teachers will actually teach particular outcomes. Yet there is an obvious need for cons istency, especially within teaching 
teams. The authors urge readers to avoid the “Tyranny of Or” and embrace the “Genius of And.” How could a district apply the Genius of And to the need for staff ownership of the curriculum and consistency of curriculum a cross the 
district?  
 5. In this chapter, there is an emphasis on the need for reducing curriculum content. What are the key points the authors make? Do you agree? Have you undertaken a process to reduce content in your school’s curriculum?  
 6. The authors note t hat “one of the most powerful, high- leverage strategies for 
improving student learning available to schools is the creation of frequent, common, high- quality formative assessments by teachers who are working 
collaboratively to help a group of students deve lop the agreed -upon knowledge 
and skills”  (page 75). What would be an appropriate response to teachers who ask 
why collaboratively developed common assessments are important? What are some potential barriers to creating common assessments? How could these barriers be overcome?  

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--13--  7. The authors also suggest that common, team -developed formative assessments are 
“so powerful  [in school improvement ] that no team of teachers should be allowed 
to opt out of creating them ” (page 76).  What are the implications of this s tatement 
for those who have different roles within the school? Specifically, consider the 
following: What is the role of the teacher (or teacher teams) in developing a system of high- quality common assessments? What is the role of the principal? 
What is th e role of the district office?  
 8. On page 63, the authors describe three things that must occur if common formative assessments are to be effective . To what degree have these occurred in 
your school or district?  If they have not occurred, what are the next s teps that 
need to be taken?  
 
9. On pages 67–69, the authors describe a number of strategies for monitoring student learning. How would you respond if there were a few teachers on the staff who indicate they simply do not want to participate in such strategies ? For 
example, consider how you might  respond to the teacher who says, “Just give me 
my kids and leave me alone!”  
 
10. It is not enough to ask teachers to focus on the critical questions of learning ; 
resources must be made available to teaching teams. Some app ropriate resources 
are suggested in this chapter. To what extent do teaching teams in your school 

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--14--  have these resources available? Are additional resources needed? If so, what are 
they?  
 
11. After reading the section “Dangerous Detours and Seductive Shortcuts ,” reflect 
on the efforts your school or district has made to avoid or overcome  similar 
“bumps in the road.”  
 
Activity  1 
In groups of three, talk about becoming a PLC, and identify two or three things you would like to have in place by the end of the year. U sing markers and chart paper, 
illustrate your vision with a drawing or graphic representation. After five  minutes, choose 
one person to report aloud to the whole group.  
 
Activity 2  
Engage your faculty and staff in the Keep, Drop, Create activity described on pages 65–
66.  
Activity 3  
Have teams review the worksheet  Assessing Y our Place on the PLC Journey Continuum 
and determine their perceptions of where your school is on the journey and the next steps that need to be taken.

How Will We Respond  
When Some Students Don’t Learn?  
 _____________________ 
 
In previous chapters, the authors make the case for collaboratively clarifying the essential 
outcomes for each subject, grade, course, and unit and for  creating common, formative, 
teacher -developed a ssessments as powerful tools for school improvement. However, in 
this chapter, the authors explain that it is pointless to clarify outcomes and develop common assessments if the school is not prepared to intervene when the staff discovers some students are  experiencing difficulty in their learning. Why should schools develop 
systematic plans to provide students with additional time and support within the school day, and how can such plans be developed? Reflect on the following questions . 
 
1. In the case study,  it became obvious to Principal Mathers that individual teachers 
responded in very different ways when students experienced difficulty in their learning. To what extent is this the case in your school? What are some of the different responses you have obse rved?  
 2. Think about Principal Mathers’ observation, “It was as if the school was playing an educational lottery with the lives of children —rolling the dice to see which 
students would receive an excellent opportunity to learn algebra and which would not.” D o you think Principal Mathers’ observations describe conditions in your 
school? In what way(s)?  
 

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--16--  3. Effectively responding to students who experience difficulty in their learning 
requires a systematic process of intervention —a collective response— rather than 
relying on the actions of individual teachers ( see page  97). If you were asked by 
the Parent Teacher Association to deliver an address on the topic of “Helping All Students Learn,” how would you describe your school’s “systematic” plan of intervention to provide students with additional time and support when they struggle with their learning?  Do you think all teachers in your school would 
provide a similar description? Is your school’s plan for providing students with additional time, support or enrichment in writing?  What would be the advantages 
of developing a written  plan that is widely distributed?  
 
4. The authors suggest that Principal Mathers might develop an intervention plan for supporting student learning by first creating a process through which the s taff 
examines the “brutal facts” of their current situation and then studies best practices for responding to students who are experiencing difficulty in their learning. Is this generally how issues are addressed in your school? What are the advantages of such a process?  
 
5. React to the following statement: “It is disingenuous for any school to claim its purpose is to help all students learn at high levels, and then fail to create a system of interventions to give struggling learners additional time and support for learning” (page 104).  

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--17--  6. React to the following statement by Cole and Schlechty (1993, p. 10): “In the 
factory model of schooling, quality was the variable; time was constant. Students were given a set amount of work to do in a set period of time, and then graded on the quality of what was accomplished. We held time constant and allowed quality to vary. We must turn that on its head and hold quality constant, and allow time to vary.” What implications does their observation have for your school?  
 7. The au thors note that when schools have successfully created systemic 
interventions to provide additional time and support for students using existing 
resources, in each case it was imperative that the staff agree to modify the schedule and assume new roles and responsibilities ( see page 99) . Suppose a 
teacher made the following observation: “We all want to provide additional time and support for students. It’s just that our schedule won’t allow it!  We simply 
cannot take any more time away from instructional time . We don’t have enough 
instructional time to cover all the material we are required to cover.”  How would 
you respond to this teacher’s concerns?  
 
8. In part two of this chapter (Here’s How), the authors make the case that schools must develop systematic  plans  to provide students with additional time and 
support within the school day. What do the authors mean by systematic ? Does 
your school have such a plan? Is your school plan timely , ensuring students get 
help when they first experience difficulty? And is it directive rather than invitational?  

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--18--  9. This chapter contains the observation that “individual teachers working in 
isolation as they attempt to help all of their students achieve at high levels will eventually be overwhelmed by the tension between covering the  content and 
responding to the diverse needs of students in a fixed amount of time with virtually no external support”  (page 104). Do you agree with this observation? 
How do you think teachers typically respond to this tension?  
 
Activity  1 
In groups of thr ee to five, list the resources you use to identify the essential outcomes in 
your school (for example, state standards, district curriculum guides, publishers’ pacing guides, or national benchmarks). In what way do these resources impact lesson plans on a weekly or a daily basis? Ask yourselves, “What is our current reality regarding essential outcomes in our district, in our school, and on our team?”  
 
Activity 2  
Working in teams, analyze the Assessing Our Progress Continuum, reflecting where your school is  on each section of the continuum and identifying the steps that need to be taken 
in order to move forward on your journey to becoming a professional learning community.  
 
Activity 3  
Create two overlapping circles.  Label the left circle “ intervention”  and t he right 
“remediation .” Have teachers brainstorm the similarities and differences in the two terms.  

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--19--  Do the same thing with the terms accommodation and  modification . What other terms are 
there that teachers should clarify ? 
 
Activity 4  
Working in teams, use the SPEED criteria on page 100 to analyze the pyramid of 
interventions in your school and identify some of the key criteria. Are they the same or 
different than the SPEED criteria ? Design your own acronym to describe the criteria of a 
quality intervention at your school.

Building the Collaborative Culture  
of a Professional Learning Community  
 _____________________ 
 
In this chapter, the authors note that the collaborative team is the fundamental building block 
of a professional learning communi ty. Members of a PLC recognize they cannot accomplish 
their fundamental purpose of high levels of learning for all students unless they work together collaboratively. The quality of work in professional learning communities depends, to a great degree, on t he quality of collaboration that is embedded into a school’s culture. 
Reflect on the following questions . 
 
1. The concept of r eciprocal  accountability  defined in the introduction is a 
particularly helpful tool for enhancing team effectiveness . How effectively  has the 
concept been utilized in your school or district to guide the work of teams?  Are 
there ways the concept could be better employed  to enhance team effectiveness?  
If so, how?  
 2. In the case study, some teachers accused Principal McDonald of abandoning the middle school concept by placing emphasis on student learning. The debate deteriorated into a choice between the emotional well -being of students versus 
ensuring all students learn at high levels. In what ways is this situation an example of the Tyrann y of Or? How could the Genius of And be utilized in such a situation?  
 

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--21--  3. Principal McDonald experienced difficulty embedding the work of collaborative 
teams into the day -to-day work of the school. What did Principal McDonald fail to 
do? If you were advising Principal McDonald, what advice would you give?  
 
4. If you were asked why schools should organize into collaborative teams, what would be your response? What evidence could you cite in your response? Is there any research that supports the contention that the  best way to organize a school is by 
having individual teachers work in isolation? What would your response be to a teacher who might say that he or she is being asked to sacrifice content time for collaborative time?  
 
5. A very effective teacher makes the fo llowing point in a meeting with the school 
principal : “I feel I am a good teacher.  I have been getting very good results with 
my students for years. In fact, my students routinely have the highest student 
achievement scores in the school and some of the be st in the district.  I understand 
the school is emphasizing the collaborative team concept and that is fine with me.  
I am not opposed. B ut I just don’t feel the need to participate. I don’t think I 
would benefit in any way and it would take away time from m e and my students. 
So I don’t want to be assigned to a team. I will continue to do a great job with my 
students. It is fine with me if other teachers are in teams, but I feel I should have 
the right to continue on my own.”  How would you respond to this tea cher?  What 
message would your response send to other teachers throughout the school?  

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--22--  6. How are teams organized in your school —by grade level, department, course, 
discipline, or by other classifications? What is the underlying rationale for the team 
structure  in your schools?  
 7. Are there situations in your school in which a single teacher may be the only teacher of a grade level or content area? In what ways do teachers in these situations  
collaborate? What suggestions do the authors offer for providing collaboration opportunities for teachers who are the only teachers in a particul ar grade level or 
content area?  
 
8. Educators frequently identify time  constraints  as the major barrier to collaboration. 
Do teachers have weekly collaborative time in your school? What are some of the suggestions found in this chapter for creating collaborative time?  
 
9. The authors note that one of the most effective ways to enhance the productivity of 
teams is to insist that they develop products or artifacts related to the critical quest ions of learning. What are some examples of these products? In your school, 
when teams are asked to develop products, are they given clear directions, expectations, research, rubrics (when appropriate), and examples?  
 
10. This chapter contains a research -based  list of characteristics of teams that 
demonstrate high emotional intelligence. Do teams in your school reflect these 

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--23--  characteristics? Which characteristics are strongest? Which characteristics seem to be 
the weakest?  
 
11. Both Daniel Goleman (2002) and Pat rick Lencioni (2005) contend that establishing 
norms is a critical factor in the effectiveness of a team, a strategy that can help determine whether a group will function as a real team or just a loose collection of individuals. If norms are the collective commitments members make to each other regarding the way in which they will work together, what commitments should you and your colleagues make to each other to increase the likelihood of your success?  
 
12. React to Michael Fullan’s (2001, p. 67) statement that “collaborative cultures, which by definition have close relationships, are indeed powerful, but unless they are focusing on the right things they may end up being powerfully wrong.” What has been your experience when working on collaborative teams? Have yo ur teams 
focused on the “right things”? What are the right things?  
 
13. It is critical that school leaders continually work to enhance the effectiveness of each team.  How should the quality of the work of teams be monitored?  How 
should teams’ effectiveness ult imately be evaluated ? 
 
Activity  1 
The authors have established that norms, protocols, and clear SMART goals help teams focus their collaborative efforts. Using the Critical Issues for Team Consideration worksheet found

school to help focus collaboration within your team. 
 
Activity 2  
Engage teams in determining their position on the Assessing Your Progress Continuum. What are the next steps teams in your school need to  take  in order to increase their 
effectiveness?

Creating a Results Orientation  
in a Professional Learning Community  
 _____________________ 
 
 
In many schools and school districts, judgments about effectiveness are linked to assessments 
of acti vities as well as to the development of plans for future improvement. While 
recognizing that planning is important, members of a PLC assess their effectiveness on the basis of results —tangible evidence their students are acquiring the knowledge, skills, and 
dispositions essential to their future success. How does a school or district create a results orientation among the very people who are called upon to improve results —the 
administrators and teachers in each school? Reflect on the following questions . 
 
1. In the case study, the district mission statement emphasized providing “a rigorous 
academic curriculum” as opposed to ensuring high levels of learning. Is there a difference between the “planned” curriculum in schools and the “learned” curriculum of student s? Has your school made the shift from a focus on teaching to a focus on 
learning? What evidence can you cite that such a shift has, in fact, taken place?  
 2. The authors draw attention to the minimal impact strategic planning has on 
learning. Examine the pla nning efforts in your district. How aligned is the goal 
setting process between the board of education, central office, building administration and classroom teacher? ( See pages 157 –158.)

(Second Edition) —Action Guide

--26--  3. It has been said that in a PLC there is a shift from a focus on inte ntions  or activities  to 
a focus on results. What does this statement mean? What are some things your school 
has done in order to develop a results orientation?  
 4. The authors suggest some important distinctions between different kinds of goals. What has your  school done to identify the difference between a stretch goal (at the 
district level) and an obtainable goal (at the team level)? ( See page s 160–1 61.) 
 
5. The authors note that a key strategy for creating a results orientation throughout the district is for leaders to (1) identify a limited number of very focused goals and (2) use well -designed processes to drive those goals, not only into each school, but also 
into every classroom. To what extent have focused learning goals been developed in your school or district? What has been the effect of focused learning goals on individual classrooms?  
 
6. It has been argued that a school can only create a results orientation by focusing on results rather than activities.  Consider the following questions  and answer each 
within the context of your school. ( See pages  157–159.)  
a) How will the achievement of goals be measured?  What are some appropriate 
indicators , measures and targets for SMART  goals.  
b) What process is in place to link SMART goals written at the individual, team, and building level to the district’s stretch goals?  

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--27--  c) What process is in place to regularly monitor the progress of individual, team, 
building and district goals?  How frequently is the progress revie wed at the 
team, building, and district level?  
 
7. This chapter  emphasizes developing SMART goals. To what degree do your school 
and/or district goals meet the SMART goals standards? Are they strategic and specific, measurable, attainable, results oriented, and time  bound?  
 8. Why should educators focus  on ensuring each collaborative team in every school is 
working toward SMART goals that are specifically linked to a few school and district goals?  
 
9. The authors recommend that teams create specific learning goals. To what degree has this been done in your school? How were t he goals developed? Have teams 
developed some short -term goals that can serve as benchmarks of progress, as well as 
a few stretch goals? Have plans been developed to monitor each team’s goals? How is this accomplished? Are team goals linked to a few school  and district goals?  
 
10. What efforts have been undertaken in your school or district to limit the number of initiatives? How does the central office staff serve as a buffer from the constant array of new ideas, fads, and initiatives? The authors emphasize the importance of developing “stop doing” lists. Have such lists been developed in your school or

Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--28--  district? What are some things that educators in your school and/or district should 
stop doing?  
 
11. Often schools and school districts are judged by the quality of  their strategic planning 
processes. The result of such processes ultimately is a document that declares and prioritizes intentions. What are the weaknesses of relying on strategic plans as a basis for assessing  effectiveness?  
 
Activity  1 
Working in grade -level or departmental teams, examine your goals from last year . Analyze 
them using the SMART goal worksheet found on page 163. Identify ways the goals for your team could be improved.  
 
Activity 2  
Obtain copies of the district and building goals. As a facul ty, produce a summary by 
school and district of those polices, practices, and procedures that do not promote a results orientation , and create specific recommendations as to what can be done to 
encourage and support a stronger connection.  
Activity 3  
Colla boratively assess your school’s place on the Assessing Your Progress Continuum. 
What are the next steps that need to be taken?

Using Relevant Information to Improve Results  
 _____________________ 
 
This chapter gives focus to the power of local ly developed common assessments. The authors 
make the case that common assessments developed by collaborative teacher teams are the 
best ways to provide powerful feedback to teachers and turn data into useful information. How can a school culture shift from being “data rich but information poor” to one in which teachers have timely access to powerful and authentic information that can impact professional practice in ways that enhance student learning? Reflect on the following questions . 
 
1. In the case study, a number of teachers raised concerns about the development and 
use of common assessments. Have (or would) teachers in your school raise similar concerns? What would some of the concerns be at your school? How would you respond to concerns about the development and use of common assessments?  
 2. The authors make the case that using protocols helps collaborative teams become more efficient an d more effective in analyzing  assessment results  (see pages 185–
190). With this  idea as a context for your discussion, rea ct to the following statement: 
“Protocols help teams be more effective and efficient in analyzing assessment results . 
Therefore, the use of some kind of protocols is expected (tight) ; however, which 
protocol to use is left to the discretion of the team (lo ose). ”

(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--30--  3. The authors contend that a PLC should create systems to ensure that each teacher 
receives frequent and timely feedback on the performance of his or her students on a valid common assessment . They argue  that these assessments must evaluate students’  
progress toward meeting an agreed -upon proficiency standard established by the 
collaborative team in comparison to other students in the school attempting to meet the same standard. They go on to advocate that every teacher should have a collaborative tea m to turn to and learn from as he or she explores ways to improve 
learning for students. To what extent does your school reflect these practices?  
 
4. Reflect on this statement: “Teams need to reach the point where they are analyzing student work, kid by  kid, skill by  skill.”  To what depth do teams 
analyze student learning in your school?  In what ways could the analysis of 
student learning be enhanced?  
 
5. Common assessments developed locally by collaborative teams of teachers provide the vehicle for creating a cu lture of continuous improvement. As the authors note, 
“Members of PLCs recognize their challenge is not to get it right and keep it going, but to ‘ get it right and make it better and better ’” (Champy, 1995, p. 27, quoted on 
page 194). Does this statement r eflect the culture of your school? If someone were to 
ask how common assessments drive a culture of continuous improvement, what would your answer be?  
 

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--31--  6. Schools or districts that hope to become professional learning communities will 
create the structures an d cultures to ensure data are easily accessible and openly 
shared among teachers who are working together interdependently toward the same SMART goal. Respond to Michael Fullan’s  belief that , in Mike Schmoker’s 
(2002) words, “successful schools are places where teams of teachers meet regularly to focus on student work through assessment and change their instructional practices accordingly to get better results ” (p. 10).  
 
7. The authors say that teacher dialogue moves from sharing opinions to building shared knowledge of best practice through the collective examination of results —
tangible evidence of student learning. How often does your team review samples of student work? Does your team adjust instruction based on the examination of student work or the results  of common assessments?  
 8. What is the difference between formative and summative assessment? Look at the last four tests that were given to your class. How many were formative, and how many were summative?  
 
Activity  1 
Appoint one member of the team as the observer while the rest of the team uses the Descriptive Review protocol described on page  189 to analyze a common assessment.  
Once the team has completed the discussion of the common assessment, talk about the pros and cons of using protocols to facilitate  the work of teams. Talk about what the 

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™

--32--  ”work ” of the team would look like if using protocols became a routine way of looking at 
improving teachers ’ professional  practice.  
 
(For more information on protocols teachers can visit the National School Reform 
Faculty website at www.nsrfharmony.org . The Looking at Student Work website at 
www.lasw.org  is another excellent site for more examples of other protocols .) 
 
Activity 2 
Collaborativ ely determine your school’s place on the Assessing Your Progress 
Continuum and determine the next steps that need to be taken.

Implementing the PLC Process Districtwide  
_____________________ 
 
In this chapter, the authors stress the importance of clear goals and priorities, arguing that 
leadership behavior must align with these goals before rhetorical commitments can be translated into specific action.  How can district leaders strike the right balance of “tight” 
and “loose” leadership styles, and ensure that each is focusing on the right areas to promote greater unity of vision and action? Reflect on the following questions . 
 
1. In the case study, Superintendent D itka saw uneven results even th ough he felt he 
had done everything right. Why was this so?  Identify three things he did well and 
three things you would recommend he do differently next time. 
 2. In your district , what systems are in place to monitor the implementation of your 
PLC initiative?  
 
3. The authors frequently refer to the importance of the concept of reciprocal accountability . What rights and obligations does this concept imply for district 
leadership and for school personnel?  Are the expectations for principals and  
teachers clear?  Are the resources needed to successfully meet those expect ations 
available?  If so, are they utilized effectively?  
 
4. The authors make the point that it is important to clarify and create agreement around common terminology  (see page 219) . Specifically, what efforts have been 

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--34--  made to clar ify terminology in your dist rict? Have these efforts been effective?  
What else could be done to create agreement around common terminology?  
 
5. The authors point out that schools seeking to implement PLC concepts in their 
schools should focus on behavior first and culture last  (see p age 213) . What steps 
have been taken to ensure faculty and staff exhibit certain behaviors throughout the district?  What are these expected behaviors?  How were they communicated?  
How are they monitored?  How have these expected behaviors affected district 
culture? 
 
6. The key to district improvement is “doing” rather than simply “knowing .” What 
has been done to build shared knowledge around specifically what needs to be done  to improve student learning  in schools throughout your district ? 
 
Activity  
 
Reflect on the  implementation process at your school , and respond to the following statement 
by Dean Fixen : “Is it possible that the improvement initiative failed because it was the wrong 
program or is it possible it was the right program poorly implemented?  To illustrate his point, 
draw a T -chart on a piece of chart paper , and think of one initiative that was implemented 
poorly and another that was implemented well. Brainstorm some possible reasons why one 
failed and a nother succeeded. Are there any similarities?  Are there differences?

Consensus and Conflict  
in a Professional Learning Community  
_____________________ 
 
It is unrealistic to think that every teacher will be enthusiastic about the various practices 
found in schools that function as professional learning communities. There are bound to be those who resist certain practices and initiatives. This fact often creates a dilemma for leaders —they  recognize the need to move forward, yet they would like t o have everyone “on 
board.” So, how does a school that functions as a PLC deal with consensus and conflict? Reflect on the following questions . 
 
1. In the case study, Principal Roth attempted to change Fred’s attitude. Have you had much success in changing th e attitude of others? After reflecting on this chapter, what 
should Principal Roth have focused on? What approach do the authors recommend for impacting someone’s attitude?  
 2. Principal Roth wanted to build consensus, yet developed no clear definition of consensus. This chapter contains a continuum of various definitions of consensus. 
Which definition fits the operational definition of consensus in your school? What do you think an appropriate definition of consensus should be? Why?  
 
3. The authors offer the fol lowing definition of consensus: “We have arrived at 
consensus when (1) all points of view have been heard and (2) the will of the group is evident even to those who most oppose it”  (page 228). What are your thoughts on this 

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--36--  definition? How does this defini tion support efforts to move forward with particular 
proposals and initiatives?  
 
4. If “getting everyone on board” is the criterion for reaching consensus in your 
school, how many faculty members would it require to block a new initiative from being undertake n? What would be the advantage of reaching a working definition 
of consensus prior to engaging faculty in discussions about possible changes or new initiatives?  
 
5. Think of a professional decision that you recently were involved in making. Did the decision -making process create winners and losers? If consensus was reached, how  
was it accomplished ? 
 
6. One of the most important ways a school’s core values are reinforced is by thoughtful, professional confrontation. We must be prepared to confront those who act in  ways that are contrary to the priorities of the school and the collective 
commitments of the staff. What behaviors are confronted in your school? What would it take for someone to point out to a staff member that his or her behavior was incongruent with t he shared values of the school?  
 
7. Garmston and Wellman (1999, p. 183) encouraged teachers to embrace the importance of conflict on collaborative teams when they suggested that “successful groups know how to fight gracefully —they embrace the positive aspects  of conflict 

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--37--  and actively minimize the negative aspects. Successful teams recognize conflict as an 
important resource for forging better practices.” How is conflict resolved on your team? How is it resolved a t your school?  
 
8. Members of a PLC understand that  the most powerful learning occurs in a context 
of taking action. What specific actions have been undertaken in your school to improve learning? How has your school dealt with those who resist any meaningful change?  
 
9. Consider the following statement: “If leaders are unwilling to deal with resisters, they are left to improve their school one retirement at a time.” Do you agree or disagree? Why?  
 
10. Andy Hargreaves  (as cited in Sparks , 2004)  has said , “Professional learning 
communities  . . . [ bring ] teachers tog ether to talk about how they can improve the 
learning of all students as they challenge and question each other’s practice in spirited but optimistic ways ” (p. 48, emphasis added). Would you describe the 
professional dialogue in your school as spirited and optimistic? If not, how would you describe the dialogue in your school?  
 
Activity 1  
The authors frequently hear that professional learning communities make sense, but often, agreement is followed by the inevitable “yes, but” statement. Statements like, 

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--38--  “Yes, it sounds great, but it would never work in our school,” or, “Yes, but we don’t have 
time to do all that work,” or, “Yes, but I can’t work with that person” are all signals of 
resistance. Write down the “yes, but” statements that you have heard when yo ur 
colleagues talk about becoming a PLC.  
 Categorize the sources of resistance into one of three categories —lack of commitment, 
lack of knowledge and skills, or a lack of confidence and self -efficacy. Once the source 
of resistance has been identified, deve lop a plan to respond in a direct and supportive 
way.  
 
Activity 2  
Think of a situation in which you would like to change someone’s mind—for example, a student, a colleague, a parent, your child, or your supervisor. Working in pairs, describe the situation,  and talk through how you could use the seven strategies identified by 
Howard Gardner  (pages 232–233)  for changing someone’s mind.

The Complex Challenge  
of Creating Professional Learning Communities  
_____________________ 
 
Becoming a PLC is m uch more than going through a certain, prescribed number of steps. 
As the authors point out, there is no recipe for reculturing schools. How  things are done is 
often as important as what  is being done. In this chapter, the authors emphasize the 
importance of hope, passion, and persistence. Reflect on the following questions . 
 
1. The authors contend that leaders must foster hope throughout the organization. Why is fostering hope so important? In what ways can hope become part of a school’s culture? How is hope connected to self -efficacy?  
 2. Reflect on this statement: “Hope burns brightest in those who believe in their ability to impact the future. Leaders of learning communities will keep hope alive in their schools and districts by modeling that belief and callin g upon all staff to do the 
same.” Can you cite an example of a person who helped you believe in your ability to succeed in a difficult situation? What did that person do to inspire hope and self -
efficacy in you?  
 
3. Why are modeling and celebrating so importa nt in a PLC? How does celebrating 
differ in a PLC from more traditional schools?  
 
4. The authors assert, “The most common cause of the demise of PLC initiatives is not the result of a single cataclysmic event . . . . They die from a thousand small wounds”  

Learning by  Doing: A Handbook for Professional Learning Communities at Work™ 
(Second Edition) —Action Guide  
 
Copyright © 2010 Solution Tree Press  
--40--  (pages 256–257). What is the message they are sending to those attempting to build 
professional learning communities?  
 
5. Being passionate is not enough. The issue is, “What are we passionate about?” What 
will be the focus of passionate endeavors in your school a s it functions as a PLC? 
What endeavors are the focus of the most passion in your school or school district?  
 
6. The authors cite Pfeffer and Sutton’s (2000)  “deceptively simple” solution to the 
knowing -doing problem. What is that solution? Cite specific exam ples of how you 
are applying it in your efforts to become a PLC.  
 
7. Ultimately, the testimonials of educators who work in schools that function as professional learning communities provide the best evidence of the power of the PLC concept. This chapter contains comments from educators who work in PLC cultures. Which of these statements had the most meaning for you? If students, parents, teachers, and administrators described working in your school, what do you think their statements would be? What would you l ike them to be?  
 
8. In what ways does the PLC concept support a conscious and sustained effort to create the conditions that allow educators to become more skillful in their profession? To what degree are these conditions present in your school?

--41--  Activity  
Think of something you are passionate about. It might be golf, painting, or exercise. It might 
be related to your family, friends, church, or school. It can be personal or professional, but it 
should be something you can discuss comfortably with a partner. W rite it down, and reflect 
for a moment.  
 Working in pairs, talk about how you feel when you are experiencing or engaged in that passion. Determine the actions or behaviors you exhibit when pursuing your passion. Did you have to learn deeply about it? Did y ou spend time improving and practicing it over and 
over? What commitments do you make to your passion? Can you imagine ways that your school can passionately pursue becoming a PLC?
